# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
Using unsupervised learning, data on a variety of cryptocurrencies was simplified and classified.
## Analysis
- Data was preprocessed using pandas and the standard scaler fit_transform function
- Data dimensions were reduced using the PCA algorithm
- The K-means algorithm was used to cluster the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data
- The cryptocurrency clusters were plotted using a 3D scatter plot, and a standard hv scatter plot (shown below)
